- MaxCharactersPerTranslation: Specifies the maximum length of a text to translate. Any texts longer than this is ignored by the plugin. Cannot be greater than 1000. Never redistribute this mod with this value greater than 400

- Do not redistribute the plugin with a non-default translation endpoint configured which comes from this repository. This means:
    Don't set Endpoint=DeepLTranslate and then redistribute.
    However, if you implemented your own endpoint or the endpoint is not a part of this repository, you can go ahead and redistribute it with that as the default endpoint.
